CMPE 255: Data Mining<br>
Assignment 1

This is the first assignment which is focused on teaching us the basics of data science. Through this assignment I learned about the various operations in data science such as Data understanding, analysis, visualization, cleaning etc.<br>

Part 1 of this assignment was to perform multiple data science operations on a dataset using the **chatgpt code interpreter**. For this I used the ["World Happiness Report up to 2022"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/world-happiness-report) kaggle dataset and performed various data science operations using chatgpt.<br>

Part 2 of this assignment was to create an application using gpt-engineer and with the help of Visual studio code extension **github copilot chat** perform multiple operations such as writing a function, testcase, and refactor it. But due to **no access to the extension (github copilot chat)** I have used used gpt-engineer to create the entire application and another visual studio code extension **github coplit** to create and refactor the test cases.<br>

**List of files:**<br>
  *Part 2/Sudoku<br>
  *Part 1<br>
  *Assignment_2_screencast.mov<br>

**Files description:**<br>
**Part 2/Sudoku** - A Sudoku GUI application which was written by gpt-engineer. I have also used VS code "github copilot" extension to refactor the code, write unit test cases and functions. It also contains a main_prompt file, which is a prompt used by gpt-engineer to create this application.<br>

**Part 1** - Contains a text file which contains a link to the medium article.<br>

**Assignment_2_screencast.mov** - A recording of me performing various actions using github copilot and displaying operations performed by gpt-engineer.
