
# Sudoku with GUI using Backtracking

## Objective
Develop a Sudoku GUI for gameplay and checking solution using a backtracking algorithm.

## Tools
- **Visual Studio Code**: Primary IDE for development
- **Python**: Main programming language
- **Tkinter**: To build the GUI component of the application
- **unittest**: Python library for unit testing

## Development Steps

### 1. Setup
- Initialize a new project in Visual Studio Code
- Install necessary Python packages
- Setup a virtual environment (recommended)

### 2. Sudoku Board Design
- Create a visually appealing 9x9 grid (3x3 grids) representation for the Sudoku board using Tkinter
- Allow user inputs in each cell of the Sudoku board

### 3. Algorithm Implementation
- Develop a backtracking algorithm to find solutions
- Incorporate validity checks and backtracking steps during the implementation

### 4. GUI Functionality
- Include buttons or menu options to reset the board, solve the Sudoku, and check user solutions
- Implement alerts for incorrect moves or successful completion

### 5. Code Refactoring
- Optimize the backtracking algorithm for better efficiency
- Enhance the GUI for improved user experience
- Modularize the code separating GUI and algorithm logic

### 6. Unit Testing
- Use the unittest library to create tests for board validity, algorithm correctness, and GUI interactions

### 7. Documentation
- Add inline comments explaining the functionality and logic of your code
- Provide a comprehensive README file detailing the features and usage instructions of the application

## How to Run
- Open the project in Visual Studio Code
- Run `main.py` to start the application
- Use the GUI to play Sudoku or solve it using the backtracking algorithm
