Let's start with the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for this project:

1. `SudokuGUI`: A class that will handle all the GUI related tasks such as drawing the board, taking user inputs, and updating the board.

2. `SudokuSolver`: A class that will implement the backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle.

3. `SudokuValidator`: A class that will validate the Sudoku board and the user's solution.

4. `SudokuGame`: A class that will control the game flow, including resetting the board, checking the solution, and solving the puzzle.

5. `main`: The main function that will create an instance of `SudokuGame` and start the game.

Now, let's move on to the implementation of each file.
